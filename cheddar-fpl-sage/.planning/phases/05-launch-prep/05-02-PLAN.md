<objective>
Create legal compliance documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy) and integrate them into the frontend as accessible pages. Ensure GDPR best practices and cover FPL Sage's data handling, usage limits, and liability disclaimers.

Purpose: Legal protection and user transparency. Required for professional launch.
Output: Legal documents in HTML format with frontend routes for user access.

  <name>Generate Terms of Service</name>
  <files>
    frontend/public/terms.html
  </files>
  <action>
Generate comprehensive Terms of Service document for FPL Sage covering:

**Structure:**
- Service description (AI-powered FPL decision recommendations)
- Usage limits (2 analyses per gameweek per FPL Team ID)
- No warranties (recommendations are suggestions, not guarantees)
- Data usage (anonymous analytics, no personal data collection beyond team_id)
- Intellectual property (user retains all rights, we don't claim FPL data ownership)
- Limitation of liability (not responsible for FPL rank changes)
- Termination (we can block abuse)
- Changes to terms (we may update, users notified via site)
- Governing law (choose jurisdiction - suggest UK or neutral)

**Tone:** Friendly but clear. Avoid legalese where possible. FPL players are global hobbyists, not lawyers.

**Key clauses:**
- "This service provides recommendations based on statistical analysis. You are solely responsible for your FPL team decisions."
- "We do not guarantee accuracy, availability, or results. Use at your own risk."
- "We store your FPL Team ID and usage counts. We do not access your FPL login credentials."
- "You may use this service 2 times per gameweek. We may adjust limits or pricing in the future."

Save as HTML with semantic structure (headings, lists, paragraphs).

Check `frontend/public/terms.html` exists and is at least 50 lines.
Verify it contains sections for: Service Description, Usage Limits, Liability, Data Usage.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Generate Privacy Policy</name>
  <files>
    frontend/public/privacy.html
  </files>
  <action>
Generate comprehensive Privacy Policy document for FPL Sage covering:

**Structure (GDPR-inspired, globally applicable):**
- What data we collect:
  - FPL Team ID (required for service)
  - Usage timestamps (for 2/GW limit enforcement)
  - Anonymous analytics (page views, no personal identification)
  - Error logs (via Sentry, anonymized)
- Why we collect it:
  - Service functionality (rate limiting)
  - Service improvement (error tracking, usage patterns)
- How we use it:
  - Stored in Redis (14-day TTL for usage data)
  - Analytics via Plausible/Umami (cookieless, privacy-focused)
  - Error tracking via Sentry (anonymized)
- Data retention:
  - Usage data: 14 days
  - Analytics: Aggregated only, no individual tracking
  - We do NOT sell or share data with third parties
- Your rights:
  - No account = no stored personal data beyond temporary usage counts
  - You can stop using the service anytime
  - Data auto-expires after 14 days
- Cookies:
  - We do not use cookies (cookieless analytics)
  - Third-party FPL API may have its own cookies
- Security:
  - Data transmitted over HTTPS
  - Redis access restricted to backend
- Contact:
  - Provide email for privacy inquiries (suggest creating one: privacy@cheddarlogic.com or similar)

**Tone:** Transparent and reassuring. Emphasize minimal data collection and privacy focus.

**Key statements:**
- "We collect minimal data: your FPL Team ID and when you use the service. That's it."
- "We do not use cookies or track you across the web."
- "Your usage data expires automatically after 14 days."
- "We never sell your data or share it with advertisers."

  <files>
    frontend/src/pages/TermsPage.tsx
    frontend/src/pages/PrivacyPage.tsx

Create `frontend/src/pages/TermsPage.tsx`:
```tsx
export default function TermsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 max-w-4xl">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Terms of Service</h1>

        className="w-full h-[80vh] border rounded"
        title="Terms of Service"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Create `frontend/src/pages/PrivacyPage.tsx`:
```tsx
export default function PrivacyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 max-w-4xl">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <iframe

        className="w-full h-[80vh] border rounded"
        title="Privacy Policy"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Update `frontend/src/App.tsx` to add routes:
- Import TermsPage and PrivacyPage
- Add routes: `/terms` -> TermsPage, `/privacy` -> PrivacyPage
- Ensure routes work with /fpl-sage base path

Add footer links (if footer exists, otherwise skip):
- Link to /terms and /privacy in app footer
  </action>
  <verify>
Check page components exist: `frontend/src/pages/TermsPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/PrivacyPage.tsx`.
Run `cd frontend && npm run dev`, navigate to http://localhost:5173/terms and http://localhost:5173/privacy - pages load.
Verify App.tsx contains Route definitions for /terms and /privacy.
  </verify>
  <done>
Legal pages are integrated into frontend with routes. Users can access Terms and Privacy Policy via /terms and /privacy URLs.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Navigate to http://localhost:5173/terms in dev mode - Terms of Service loads.
Navigate to http://localhost:5173/privacy in dev mode - Privacy Policy loads.
Check both HTML documents are comprehensive (50+ lines each).
Verify documents cover: liability disclaimers, data collection, usage limits, GDPR-inspired rights.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Terms of Service exists and covers usage, liability, data handling
- Privacy Policy exists and addresses GDPR best practices
- Both documents accessible via frontend routes (/terms, /privacy)
- Legal pages load correctly in development server
- Documents are clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly
