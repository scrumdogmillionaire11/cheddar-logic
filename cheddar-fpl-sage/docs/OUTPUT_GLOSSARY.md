A: Making a transfer beyond your free transfers costs -4 points per extra transfer. This is called "taking a hit."

**Q: When should I take a hit?**
A: Only when the expected point gain (Δ pts) significantly exceeds the hit cost over 4-6 gameweeks.

**Q: What does "Net £" mean?**
A: The change to your remaining budget. Positive means you're banking money, negative means you're spending from your bank.

**Q: What's the difference between captain and vice captain?**
