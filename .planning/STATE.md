# Project State

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid stale status drift.

## Authoritative Source of Truth

- Active and upcoming work: `WORK_QUEUE/WI-####.md`
- Completed work: `WORK_QUEUE/COMPLETE/WI-####.md`
- Work-item scope/acceptance always governs completion status.

## How To Read Current Project Status

- What is in progress: claimed items in `WORK_QUEUE/`
- What is done: items moved to `WORK_QUEUE/COMPLETE/`
- What is obsolete/superseded: explicit status notes inside the WI file

## Review Cadence

- Last reviewed: 2026-03-13
- Next action for operators/agents: assess and prioritize directly from `WORK_QUEUE/`
